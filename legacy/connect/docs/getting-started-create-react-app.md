## Getting Started with ylem and create-react-app

The best way to get started with **ylem** is [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). First make sure you have `npx` installed globally:

_`npx` is already packaged with npm version 5.2+_
```sh
npm install npx -g
```

Next, generate your react app - we are calling it `my-app`:

```sh
npx create-react-app my-app
```

Now `cd` into the directory that was just created for you.
```sh
cd my-app
```

And then start up the demo app that create-react-app has generated for you

```sh
npm start
```

Now open http://localhost:3000/ to see the demo app in action.

That's it!

From here you can [continue with the getting started guide](../README.md#step-2), where you'll modify `src/App.js` to use **ylem**.
